# Homework 2: Skiplists and Hash Tables
# CS 201 Data Structures II, Spring 2020

-------

This homework explores skiplists and hash tables through implementation and through conceptual problems.

A partial implementation of Conway's Game of Life is provided. It has to be completed by implementing different hash tables that use chaining and linear probing for conflict resolution.

Insight into skiplists is developed and probed through conceptual questions.

A bonus questions demonstrates the efficiency of skiplists by using them to implement an unordered set to be used in a text search application.

## Purpose

This homework provides insight into hash tables and skiplists. In some cases, this is achieved by asking you to implement the structure. In others, through asking you to think about slight variations to the default structure. 

## Background

For this assignment, you should
- understand the structure skiplists 
- understand the operations supported by skiplists, especially *find_predecessor()*.
- understand hashing and hash tables
- understand conflicts and conflict resolution strategies in hash tables
- be comfortable with object oriented programming
- be comfortable with programming in a high level language, preferably python
- be able to problem solve
